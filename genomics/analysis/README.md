# A quick note about file extensions:
## Files ending in .md should display like a webpage in github.  You can click on the file and see a lovely version with clickable links, code blocks, and table of contents navigation.  

## Files ending in .nb.html are R-notebooks that are intended to be downloaded and then can either be viewed in a web browser for the same view you had in github with the .md or can be opened in RStudio and the raw code that generated the document is available.  


**This is helpful when you want to take a protocol, find and replace some file names to make it your own, and run the analysis/protocol on your own.**  
### Also of note: When working with the document in Rstudio, all of the chunks have been deactivated so that they will play nicely with github; they all have eval=FALSE.  I find it helpful to change the FALSE to TRUE as I go through the steps, so I know which step I am on.  Because it can take days or weeks to work through the protocol, having a method to keep track of which step you are on is very helpful.
