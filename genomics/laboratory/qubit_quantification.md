This protocol assumes that you have read and understand the manufacturer’s instructions attached below.  Please read the full manufacturer’s instructions before using this abbreviated protocol.

- Pull out enough thin wall 0.5mL tubes for all of the samples plus 2 for standards
- Label the tubes (just have to put numbers on the top)
- vortex sample well, spin down
- Make working solution:

    - Multiply the number of samples +2 by 200
        - example: 10 samples +2 = 12 x 200 = 2400
    - subtract the number of samples plus two (example = 2388)
    - To create working solution(WS) add that volume of buffer to a tube
    - add the number of samples + 2 of dye (example = 12, total volume of working solution should be 2400 in this example)
- Place 190µL  WS in 2 standard tubes
- Place 199µL  WS in sample tubes
- add 10µL standards to standard tubes
- add 2 µL sample to sample tubes
- vortex each tube 2-3 seconds
- incubate in the dark 2 min
- Read on machine (adjust volume/units, save)
- Export data to thumb drive
- Once you have verified that you have safely stored all of the data on the computer, clear the data on the qubit machine

On computer, in finder, move file from thumb drive to google docs folder>qubit files>folder of the month
Online, open the .csv file with Google Sheets

- select all
- choose data>sort range…
- click the box “Data has header row”
- Sort by date
- Double check that samples are in order of time stamp
- Rename column A to be names of samples (E110, E111, etc)
- Fill in the stock conc. column taking into account the dilution factor
- If you use a formula to fill in the stock conc. column, copy and paste “values only” to get rid of the formulas
- copy the stock conc. column over to the Sample_Data file (if you are quantifying PCR products, enter this data on the PCR sheet).
