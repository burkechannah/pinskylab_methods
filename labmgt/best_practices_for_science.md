## Best practices for doing science in the Pinsky lab
#### Based on a lab conversation 7/11/2017


* Lab notebook
  * Keep a lab notebook to record what you did, what learned, and what you produced (files, results, etc.) each day.
  * At the moment, I don’t care what format this takes: physical notebook, text file (could be a file with each project), Evernote, Jupyter notebooks, etc.
* Raw data w/ metadata
  * Store your raw data with metadata describing what’s in the file and what the columns, etc., mean
  * “Raw" means no cleaning, trimming, editing, etc.
* Scripts
  * Use scripts to process data, make models, do analyses, etc.
* Git and Github
  * Track file versions with Git and Github. I’m happy to make you a private repository on the lab account if you want.
  * Try it out if you haven’t yet. The Github Desktop app is easy to use, but RStudio and command line are other options.
* Back up
  * Two harddrives in separate physical locations.
  * Storing files on Amphiprion will do this, since it is backed up offsite.
  * I’m happy to buy you an external drive for use in the office.
