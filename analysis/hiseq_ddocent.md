It is good to be comfortable with command line processes before beginning sequencing analysis. Codecademy ([https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-the-command-line]) has a very great introductory command line tutorial that will help you dive into these processes.  The python tutorial is also great for learning how to develop your own scripts.

Jon Puritz has a great tutorial that explains the inner workings of the dDocent pipeline, but that also has great tools for command line analysis of sequencing files and graphing on his github, to download it into your amphiprion account, type:
