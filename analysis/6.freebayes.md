When dDocent has finished, change directories to the main analysis folder which contains all of the symlinks for all of the seq files in the project and call SNPS:

    Symlink the *.F.fq.gz, *.R1.fq.gz, *-RG.bam, and *-RG.bam.bai files to the main analysis folder from the final destination APCL_analysis/17_03seq - **Symlinking must be done from within the destination directory**

    `mkdir 17-03seq`

    `ln -s ../../17seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../16seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../15seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../13seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../12seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../09seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../08seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../07seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../05seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../04seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../03seq/samples/APCL* ./`


Run the script [call_SNPs.sh](https://github.com/stuartmichelle/Genetics/blob/master/code/call_SNPs.sh) which calls freebayes from the command line instead of using dDocent.  Currently, dDocent is creeping up in memory usage as it goes through the files until the system crashes after 8 days.  This alternate script only uses 4G of memory and finishes in about 2 days.
