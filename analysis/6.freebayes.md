When dDocent has finished, change directories to the main analysis folder which contains all of the symlinks for all of the seq files in the project and call SNPS (some of the files have been moved out of the main directories because they have issues or are regenotypes; run the scripts `../../scripts/mvfromprobsamp.sh` or `../scripts/mvtoprobsamp.sh` to put these files into or out of the analysis):

    Symlink the *.F.fq.gz, *.R1.fq.gz, *-RG.bam, and *-RG.bam.bai files to the main analysis folder from the final destination APCL_analysis/17_03seq - **Symlinking must be done from within the destination directory**

    `mkdir 17-03seq`

    `ln -s ../../17seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../16seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../15seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../13seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../12seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../09seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../08seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../07seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../05seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../04seq/samples/APCL* ./`

    `ln -s ../../03seq/samples/APCL* ./`


Run the script [call_SNPs.sh](https://github.com/stuartmichelle/Genetics/blob/master/code/call_SNPs.sh) which calls freebayes from the command line instead of using dDocent.  Currently, dDocent is creeping up in memory usage as it goes through the files until the system crashes after 8 days.  This alternate script only uses 4G of memory and finishes in about 2 days.

When freebayes is done calling SNPs, remove the mapped.\*.bed files:

`rm mapped.\*.bed`

or move them into a new directory instead of deleting them in case there is a problem with the run
`mkdir mapped`
`mv mapped.\*.bed mapped`

Rename all of the raw files that are only a single digit

`mv raw.1.vcf raw.01.vcf`

`mv raw.2.vcf raw.02.vcf`

`mv raw.3.vcf raw.03.vcf`

`mv raw.4.vcf raw.04.vcf`

`mv raw.5.vcf raw.05.vcf`

`mv raw.6.vcf raw.06.vcf`

`mv raw.7.vcf raw.07.vcf`

`mv raw.8.vcf raw.08.vcf`

`mv raw.9.vcf raw.09.vcf`
    
Combine all of the vcf files into one file - takes about 10 hours:

`vcfcombine raw.*.vcf | sed -e 's/	\.\:/	\.\/\.\:/g' > TotalRawSNPs.vcf`

Move all of the raw files into a new directory:

`mkdir raw.vcf`

`mv raw.*.vcf ./raw.vcf`
