Methods used by many of us in the lab

### field  

This folder contains scripts used in the Philippines by the Leyte team to input and process data sheets.  It also contains data from the temperature loggers and GPS data.

### genomics  

This folder contains subfolders and guides to help lab members working with DNA in the laboratory and also with bioinformatics.

### labmgt  

This folder contains protocols for general lab management such as how to create backups.

### procedural_notebooks  

This folder contains a series of R notebooks that *hopefully* carry the reader through both the computing end of lab protocols (i.e. pulling data from the database and planning labwork) through the laboratory end of the protocols (i.e. step by step procedures in the lab).  These notebooks generate PDF documents that can be added to one's lab notebook, customized for the labwork done that day.
