randquads.r: generates quadrat locations along each transect (see random_transect_points.md)

### The repository [field](https://github.com/pinskylab/field) replaced these scripts in 2018.  
### Maps are made using the scripts and data in the [Phils_GIS_R](https://github.com/pinskylab/Phils_GIS_R) repository.
