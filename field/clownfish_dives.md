Description of how the dive is planned and swum, Tech 2 pulls the GPS (recording position every 15 seconds), Tech 2 records all anemones (empty and not empty), anemone IDs where labelled, and the fish on each anemone.

Field tech #1 catches the fish and holds it for tech 2

While Field tech #2 measures the fish with calipers, Field tech #3 photographs fish in the calipers so that photos and size can be assigned to fish number later (Malin: How are the photos matched to the fish? Put photo number on the data sheet?).

Field tech #2 records anemone number,  size & tail color on data sheet (and time to the nearest second when near the home anemone)

Field tech #2 scans fish to see if it is tagged.

- if tagged, Field tech #2 records tag number on data sheet and Field tech #1 releases fish.
- if not tagged, tech 2 takes fin clip, inserts pit tag, and records fin clip number and pit tag number on data sheet.  After these have been recorded, field tech #1 can release fish.

If anemone is not tagged, tech 1 hammers tag into substrate near the anemone where he caught the fish.  A zip tie is included in the hole of the tag to stick up as a flag once the tag has been covered with algae.

Field tech 3 passes pit tag scanner and pit tag needles to field tech 2 when needed.

End of the Day - clownfish
