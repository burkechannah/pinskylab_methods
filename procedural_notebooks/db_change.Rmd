Access database.
```{r workspace, echo = F, message=FALSE}
source("../genomics/scripts/lab_helpers.R")
write <- write_db(params$db)
library(knitr)
```
Find the range of rows to be changed
```{r change}
# pull in all table

change <- readr::read_csv("extraction_id, sample_id, method, well, notes
  E5299, APCL18_004, Ali, A12, Second half of fin clip used in test extraction
  E5300, APCL18_008, Ali, B12, Second half of fin clip used in test extraction
  E5301, APCL18_009, Ali, C12, Second half of fin clip used in test extraction
  E5302, APCL18_021, Ali, D12, Second half of fin clip used in test extraction

  E5306, APCL18_060, Ali, H12, Second half of fin clip used in test extraction")

```
Write to database
```{r write}
# dbWriteTable(write, params$type, change, row.names = F, overwrite = F, append = T)
# dbDisconnect(write)
