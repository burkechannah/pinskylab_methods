title: "Make platemap from database well locations"
output: html_notebook
---

This document will generate a platemap based on the well locations recorded in the database.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("genomics/scripts/lab_helpers.R")
lab <- read_db("Laboratory")
```
Which plate would you like to make a map for?
```{r}
plate_name <- "D4888-D4946"
```

Make a plate map:
```{r}
map <- lab %>% 
  tbl("digest") %>% 
  filter(plate == plate_name) %>% 
  collect()

map <- plate_from_db(map, "digest_id")

knitr::kable(platemap)
```
