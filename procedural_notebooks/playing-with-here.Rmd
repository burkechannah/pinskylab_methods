```{r}
# install.packages("here")

library(here)
```

The output will show you the working directory
```{r}
here()
```

The output shows the first argument, second argument and third argument as levels in the directory
```{r}
here("one", "two", "awesome.txt")
```

```{r}
cat(readLines(here("one", "two", "awesome.txt")))
```


here::here() figures out the top-level of your current project using some sane heuristics. It looks at working directory, checks a criterion and, if not satisfied, moves up to parent directory and checks again. Lather, rinse, repeat.

Here are the criteria. The order doesnâ€™t really matter because all of them are checked for each directory before moving up to the parent directory:

Is a file named .here present?
Is this an RStudio Project? Literally, can I find a file named something like foo.Rproj?
Is this an R package? Does it have a DESCRIPTION file?
Is this a remake project? Does it have a file named remake.yml?
Is this a projectile project? Does it have a file named .projectile?
Is this a checkout from a version control system? Does it have a directory named .git or .svn? Currently, only Git and Subversion are supported.
If no criteria match, the current working directory will be used as fallback. Use set_here() to create an empty .here file that will stop the search if none of the other criteria apply. dr_here() will attempt to explain why here decided the root location the way it did. See the function reference for more detail.
