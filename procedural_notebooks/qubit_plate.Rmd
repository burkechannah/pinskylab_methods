title: "Qubit quantification of digest plate"

*This protocol assumes that you have read and understand the manufacturer’s instructions attached below.  Please read the full manufacturer’s instructions before using this abbreviated protocol.*

This protocol is to quantify a digest plate that has been cleaned.  This is not the manufacturers method of quantification and is not recommended without testing against other methods for accuracy.  

1. For a full plate of 96 wells, make a working solution of HS buffer and dye by combining 19mL + 502uL of HS buffer with 98uL of HS dye.  (96 wells plus 2 standards)

2. Place 190 uL of working solution into an empty well and add 10uL of standard 1.
3. Place 190 uL of working solution into an empty well and add 10uL of standard 2.
4. For the rest of the wells, add 199uL of working solution with a multichannel pipet
5. Add 1uL sample to each well
5. Vortex the plate
6. Allow the plate to incubate 2 minutes.
6. Qubit the standards
7. Qubit the wells by cutting the plate apart, being very careful to keep track of the order that the wells are analyzed.
8. Export data to usb drive by hitting the data button and then the image of the usb drive.
9. Once you have verified that you have safely stored all of the data on the computer, clear the data on the qubit machine

10. Import the qubit results to the database

```{r}
# update parameters for the current analysis ####
# name of results file
### HAVE TO CHANGE THE MICROLITER SYMBOL TO UL INSTEAD OF THE SPECIAL CHARACTER ###
infile <- "../laboratory/data/QUBIT_2018-05-15_2-06-PM.csv"

# date of qubit analysis
# today <- Sys.Date()
today <- "2018-05-15"

# name of plate measured
this_plate <- "E4478-E4550"

# type of plate 
type <- "extraction"
id <- "extraction_id"

# type of analysis - HS or BR
anly <- "HS"
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("genomics/scripts/lab_helpers.R")
library(knitr)
lab <- read_db("Laboratory")
qubit <- read.csv(infile, header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)

### you get an error because there is a special symbol in the header row, change micro symbol to u ###

# eliminate unwanted data by date
qubit <- qubit %>% 
  filter(grepl(today, Date.Time)) %>% 
  select(Date.Time, Assay.Conc., Name) %>% 
  arrange(Name)

# create a table of samples that were measured
samples <- lab %>%
  tbl(type) %>%
  filter(plate == this_plate & is.na(quant)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  mutate(row = substr(well, 1, 1), 
    col = as.numeric(substr(well, 2, 3))) %>% 
  arrange(col, row) %>% 
  select(contains("id"))

# attach to qubit results
qubit <- cbind(qubit, samples)


# calculate ng/ul
qubit <- qubit %>% 
  mutate(quant = ifelse(anly == "HS", as.numeric(Assay.Conc.) * 0.2, as.numeric(Assay.Conc.) * 200)) %>%
      select(contains("id"), quant)
    
    
    kable(qubit)
    
    ```
### Update database rows
```{r echo = F}
wlab <- write_db("Laboratory")

full <- lab %>%
  tbl(type) %>%
  collect()


```
Uncomment the write to database line if it is time to commit the changes to the databse.
```{r}
if (id == "extraction_id"){
  change <- full %>%
  filter(extraction_id %in% qubit$extraction_id) %>% 
  select(-quant)
  change <- left_join(change, select(qubit, -sample_id), by = "extraction_id") 
  full <- change_rows(full, change, "extraction_id")
  # dbWriteTable(lab, "extraction", full, row.names = F, overwrite = T)
  
}

if (id == "digest_id"){
  change <- full %>%
  filter(digest_id %in% qubit$digest_id) %>% 
  select(-quant)
  change <- left_join(change, select(qubit, -extraction_id), by = "digest_id") 
  full <- change_rows(full, change, "digest_id")
  # dbWriteTable(lab, "digest", full, row.names = F, overwrite = T)
}
```
