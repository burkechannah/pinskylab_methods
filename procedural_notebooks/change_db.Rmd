Access database.
```{r echo = F, message=FALSE}
source("../genomics/scripts/lab_helpers.R")
write <- write_db(params$db)
library(knitr)
```
Find the range of rows to be changed
```{r}
# pull in all table
dat <- dbReadTable(write, params$type)

change <- dat %>% 
  filter(sample_id == "APCL18_235" | sample_id == "APCL18_259") %>% 
  mutate(notes = "Sample tube did not contain ethanol and was stinky, fin was degraded, no longer useable")


dat <- change_rows(dat, change, params$id)
```
Write to database
```{r}
# dbWriteTable(write, params$type, dat, row.names = F, overwrite = T)
# dbDisconnect(write)
```
