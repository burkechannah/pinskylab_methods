Access database.
```{r echo = F, message=FALSE}
source("../genomics/scripts/lab_helpers.R")
write <- write_db(params$db)
library(knitr)
```
Find the range of rows to be changed
```{r}
# pull in all table
dat <- dbReadTable(write, params$type)

change <- dat %>% 
  filter(anem_table_id >= 9030, anem_table_id <= 9034) %>% 
  mutate(anem_table_id = 8100,
    correction = "Y",
    corr_message = "Changed anem_table_id to 8100 because the fish observations on the anemone table were deleted", 
    corr_date = "2018-07-12",
    corr_editor = "MRS")

dat <- change_rows(dat, change, params$id)
```
Write to database
```{r}
# dbWriteTable(write, params$type, dat, row.names = F, overwrite = T)
# dbDisconnect(write)
```
