Some of the samples in the ligation table have a note that says "questionable sample identity".  Moving these to the known issues table

Pull the info from the database
```{r pull info from database, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("../genomics/scripts/lab_helpers.R")
lab <- read_db("Laboratory")

issues <- lab %>% 
  tbl("ligation") %>% 
  collect() %>% 
  filter(grepl("2015-09-01", notes), 
    !is.na(plate)) %>% 
  select(ligation_id, notes) %>% 
  rename(issue = notes)

knitr::kable(issues)
```

Write info  to known_issues in database
```{r}
w_lab <- write_db("Laboratory")
dbWriteTable(w_lab, "known_issues", issues, append = T, row.names = F)
dbDisconnect(w_lab, lab)
rm(w_lab, lab)
```
